        topic: "How the Internet Works (Clients, Servers)",
        content: `The internet is a globally interconnected network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. At its core, the most fundamental interaction is the **client-server model**. Think of it as a request-and-response system. Your web browser, running on your device, is the **client**â€”itâ€™s the machine that initiates a request for a resource. A **server** is a powerful computer, often located in a large data center, that stores files, data, and websites. When you want to visit a website, you are essentially asking a server to send you a copy of its files.

The process begins when you type a URL into your browser's address bar. This seemingly simple action triggers a complex series of events. First, your computer needs to figure out the numeric address of the server, which is its **IP address**. To do this, your computer sends a request to a **Domain Name System (DNS)** server. The DNS acts like the internetâ€™s phonebook, translating the human-friendly domain name (like "www.example.com") into the machine-readable IP address (like "93.184.216.34"). Once your computer has the IP address, it knows exactly where to send its request.

Next, your browser packages up the request as a series of data packets. This is governed by the **TCP/IP protocol suite**. TCP (Transmission Transmission Control Protocol) breaks the request into smaller packets, ensuring they are sent reliably and in the correct order. IP (Internet Protocol) handles the routing, adding the source and destination IP addresses to each packet so they know where to go. The packets then begin their journey across the network. They travel through a series of **routers**, which are like traffic cops for the internet, directing the packets along the most efficient path to their destination. Each router reads the destination IP address and forwards the packet to the next router on the route.

When the packets finally arrive at the server, they are reassembled to form the original request. The server's web server software (like Apache or Nginx) receives this request and processes it. It determines which files the client is asking for (e.g., the home page, an image, or a stylesheet). The server then retrieves these files from its storage.

After gathering all the necessary files, the server creates an **HTTP response**. This response includes a status code (like **200 OK** for success) and the requested content, which is typically a bundle of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The response is also broken down into packets and sent back to your computer through the same network of routers.

Once your browser receives all the response packets, it reassembles the files. The browserâ€™s **rendering engine** then goes to work. It first reads the **HTML** to understand the structure of the webpage. Then, it applies the **CSS** to style the elements and give them color, layout, and visual appeal. Finally, it executes the **JavaScript**, which adds dynamic behavior and interactivity to the page, such as animations, form validation, and real-time updates. This entire process, from typing a URL to seeing the fully rendered page, happens in a fraction of a second, demonstrating the incredible speed and efficiency of the modern internet.`

        topic: "HTTP/HTTPS Protocols",
        content: "**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the fundamental set of rules for how clients and servers exchange data. It's the language they speak. All web requests are HTTP requests, and all server responses are HTTP responses. **HTTPS** is the secure version of HTTP. The 'S' stands for Secure, and it means the data exchanged between your browser and the server is encrypted using a protocol called TLS (Transport Layer Security). This encryption scrambles the data, making it unreadable to anyone who might intercept it. This is crucial for protecting sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and personal details. You can always tell if a website is using HTTPS by looking for the padlock icon in the address bar."

However, humans find it much easier to remember names like `www.google.com`. The DNS's job is to translate these human-friendly domain names into the machine-friendly IP addresses that computers need to find the right server. When you type a domain name, your computer sends a query to a DNS server, which finds the correct IP address and sends it back, allowing the client to connect to the right server. "

Different browsers have their own rendering engines; for example, Chrome uses Blink and Firefox uses Gecko. The `document` and `window` objects that JavaScript interacts with are created by this rendering engine."

The **domain name** (`example.com`) is the human-readable address. The **path** (`/about/us`) specifies the exact location of a resource on the server.

For example, you can write `const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;` directly in your JavaScript code." },

Think of a web page broken down into smaller parts: a `Header` component, a `Button` component, or a `UserProfile` component. Each component has its own logic and can be used on its own or nested inside other components, allowing for modular and organized code. This approach makes large applications much easier to manage." },

They are read-only and immutable. **State** is data that a component can manage and change over time. When a component's state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new state. This simple principle of unidirectional data flow is key to how React works." },
      { id: "t38", topic: "React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)", content: "**Hooks** are special functions that let you 'hook into' React features from your functional components. `useState` is for managing state within a component. `useEffect` is for handling side effects like fetching data or setting up event listeners, and it runs after the component renders. `useContext` provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to manually pass props down at every level, which is known as prop drilling. Hooks are the modern way to write React code." },

To render a list of items, you can use the `.map()` array method to iterate over an array of data and return a list of components for each item. This is a powerful feature for building dynamic UIs, such as a list of search results or a to-do list." },
      { id: "t40", topic: "Handling Forms in React", content: "In React, forms are often managed as **controlled components.** This means that the form's input values are stored in the component's state, and their values are updated with an event handler (e.g., `onChange`). This provides more control over the form data and allows for real-time validation and feedback. It prevents the DOM from holding its own state and keeps the data consistent with your component's state." },

          <strong>Backend development</strong> is the practice of building the
          server-side logic and infrastructure that power web and mobile

          as Node.js, Express, Python, or Java, and managing databases like
          MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. Backend developers handle
          authentication, data storage, APIs, and business logic, ensuring that
