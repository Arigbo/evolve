          <strong>Backend development</strong> is the practice of building the
          server-side logic and infrastructure that power web and mobile

          as Node.js, Express, Python, or Java, and managing databases like
          MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL. Backend developers handle
          authentication, data storage, APIs, and business logic, ensuring that
